<p>When I was a little girl, I had always wanted to find a kitten with a gorgeous bow as a gift for me-for my birthday or Christmas. I've grown up with cats around me all my life, but there was something about having a cat that was "mine" that really appealed to me. When I got my 2 cats I could call my own, I felt in love with cats even more.
There are a lot of things that really need to be thought of before you add that new member to your family.</p>
